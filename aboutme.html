            <p class="aboutp">Hey, My name is Tia</p>
            <p class="aboutp">This is a website I've created for people to get to know me and who I am as a person a
                little better.</p>
            <p class="aboutp">This entire site was created using standard HTML and all of the CSS was coded by myself
                from scratch. Since starting this site I am sufficient in so many new technologies, libraries,
                frameworks which means I would probably never create another site like this ever again which is why I
                decided to keep it as it is</p>
            <p class="aboutp">I would babble on about what those new skills and technologies i've picked up along my
                journey to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer but you can find all of that on my CV so I wont bore you.
                This is a fun, easy and hopefully aesthetically pleasing space for you to look around and enjoy.</p>
            <p class="aboutp">So please have a look around and I would love to hear from you if you like what you see
                here!</p>
