            <h3>Three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning</h3> 
              <p>
                 <ol>
                    <li class="lessonlist">
                         How to Recognise my Inner Critic<br>
                         The first thing I learnt was how to recognise my inner critic, the voice in my head that makes me doubt myself and tells me that I can't do something. The most important part about being able to recognise this inner critic is that I am able to stop it in its tracks before I let it derail me. When I recognise the voice telling me I cant do something I am able to remind myself of my Strengths and remind myself that anything is possible and anything is learnable through hardwork, effort and persistance. <br><br> 
                    </li>

                    <li class="lessonlist">
                        That EVERYTHING is Learnable<br>
                        The second thing I learnt is that "Everything is Learnable". The most important thing about learning this is that whenever I want to give up on something and try to convince myself that I am unable to do something I know that this is just a cop out due to knowing that everything is learnable. <br><br> 
                   </li>

                   <li class="lessonlist">
                        That I am quite self aware<br>
                        Going through all these core learnings has shown me how I am quite self aware and am able to be honest with myself and recognise my strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>

              <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3> 
              <p>
                  The role of values, empathy and self and awareness in learning and programming is that it makes a huge difference in the speed of your learning, the efficiency and the quality. When you know what your strengths and weaknesses are you know where to focus more of your effort, it also helps you to know when tobe easier on yourself when struggling with certain things and when you just need to push through. Knowing your values helps you to find a learning style that is true to yourself.

              <h3>What surprised me the most about Core Learning? </h3> 
              <p>
                The biggest surprise for me was how much of the core fundamental learnings I had already learnt and heard about before. It reinforced to me how important the core learnings were anyhow they are so beneficial not just for my coding journey but for my life in general.

              <h3>The most challenging aspects of the Core Learning for me. </h3> 
              <p>
                The most challenging aspect of the core learning for me was implementing the practices and habits that I know are good for me and sticking with them. I have known for awhile the amazing benefits of meditating daily but have always struggled to turn this practice into a daily habit that becomes a non negotiable.

              <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3> 
              <p>
                Because all the technical skills needed for a job can always be taught on the job however the core learning is not and it is usually the core lessons and skills that differentiate a great employee from an average one. 
                <br>The core lessons taught are the ones that employers are looking for and also the skills that will aid your technical skills and allow you to be a better employee.

              <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? </h3> 
              <p>
                  Not at all, I LOVED the Core Learning!

              <h3>Final Reflections before Bootcamp</h3> 
              <p>
                Upon leaving Dev Academy I would love to become a Junior Developer so I can add to the skills I have gained and build up the confidence to one day be able to work remotely as a Developer in the Tech World.<br> 

                <br>I am someone who loves having the freedom to do what I want, when I want and being able to work from a laptop anywhere in the world is really the kind of life I want to create for myself and if I could inspire other Māori to think about a career in the Tech World that would be amazing. <br>

                <br> Funnily enough I think that one of the Strengths I named for Foundations was possibly one of my weaknesses. I definitely thought pre foundations I was able to pick things up and understand things really easily but that was before I had encountered JavaScript. But interestingly after reading over what I had put down as to what my limitations may be, it is exactly how I am feeling right now. So that was actually refreshing to read, and an encouragement that how I’m feeling was already pre-empted so I just need to push through. <br>

                <br> I think my biggest non-technical challenge at BootCamp will be my discipline to sticking to what I need to do when distractions come up. I am someone who can easily be distracted especially social wise. I truly know that this Bootcamp is priority in my life for the next 9 weeks so when distractions and temptations come up over the next 9 weeks I need to be able to resist them and realise that sacrifices will need to be made in order to stay focused over the course of bootcamp. <br>

                <br> During my time at EDA I would love to work on my skills at asking for help. It's not that I don’t like receiving or don’t need any help, it's just that my stubborn independence can definitely get in my way sometimes and is a detriment to myself. Remembering that I don’t have to do everything myself and that there is so much available to me will definitely help me to go further and learn more. One of my favourite quotes at the moment is “If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go further go together”. <br>

                <br> During Bootcamp my first point of call for help after exhausting Google and other problem solving techniques will definitely be from my fellow co-horts. I find that usually if you’re struggling with something then the chances that someone else is struggling with the exact same thing and the chances that someone else also knows how to fix the problem are also high. If I can’t seem to find what I need from them I will definitely then seek help from a facilitator as that’s what they are there for and are always so helpful. <br>

                <br> I plan to manage my workload by using time boxing and committing to certain periods of time where I am just working on code and what I need to be doing without any distractions. One of my biggest hurdles I believe will be my ability to become easily distracted. To try and combat this I am letting all the people around me know that between the hours of my study to please try and not distract me unless it is important. <br>
