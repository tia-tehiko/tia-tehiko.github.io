                    <h3 class="question">What is my long term goal & Career Pathway?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">The Tech Career I envision for myself is that upon graduating from Dev Academy I would love to find a position as a Junior Web Developer which is where I would gain experience and knowledge as an actual working Web Developer. 
                        Moving from there once confident I would love to work remotely as a Web Developer and spend a year or two travelling. 
                        But my big dream and long term goal is that I would love to start my own Web Development company that would make it a priority to encourage young Māori, Pacifica and females to get into the Tech Industry. When I was personally doing research for if the Tech Industry was for me I couldn’t help but notice there were almost no spaces/companies for young Māori females in the Tech Industry so I would love to create one. </p>

                    <h3 class="question">Which Human Skill would I most like to Develop and Improve?</h3>
                    <p class="question">I would love to get better at being decisive and making decisions, Empathy and also the ability to have and also initial tough and uncomfortable conversations as I will tend to avoid doing this which usually is to my detriment. </p>

                    <h3 class="question">Some of my Strengths </h3>
                    <p class="question">Some of my strengths that I think would relate to my learning career and development are my ability to adapt and pick up new skills and information, my organisation, my easy going nature, my love for learning new things, my hardworking nature and my practicality. </p>

                    <h3 class="question">And some of my Limitations</h3>
                    <p class="question">In terms of limitations the flip side of being very adaptable and welcoming change means that at times I can find it difficult to focus as the initial excitement of change wares off I sometimes can easily lose interest which will result in my focus lacking.
                        I can also be very indecisive which can be very counter productive. </p>

                    <h3 class="question">How will I manage my time and Workload?</h3>
                    <p class="question">I am someone who throughly enjoys and thrives off of having a schedule. Most of my life my days have been structured as the standard Monday-Friday is school & work and the weekend is rest. So for Foundations I will keep the same schedule as it is what works and plan to do course work from 10am-3pm with a lunch break in between. 
                        At the beginning of my day before the 10am start time for course work I will write out my goals and challenges for the day (First 2 questions of the “4 Questions to ask yourself everyday”). I will also look over the course content and determine what work I will do that day and then TimeBox each section to make sure I am staying on track ad not being distracted. I will start out using Time boxing and then also try the Pomodoro technique and see which technique works the best for me and has me working the most efficient. 
                        At the end of the day I will finish with the last 2 questions which will be reviewing if I achieved my goals. If no, why not? And if yes, are my goals possibly too easy or just where they should be. And the second question will be reviewing what I have learned that day. 
                        At the end of the day I will also clean up my work area and set it up for the next day so it is ready for me to walk straight in and start working immediately. This will prevent fussing around in the morning, wasting time and will make me less likely to procrastinate.</p>

                    <h3 class="question">My commitment to where & how I will seek help</h3>
                    <p class="question">I have created a note on my phone so when any non urgent questions come up I will quickly add them in before I forget so I can have them on add for my weekly check in with Lache. 
                        If anything comes up that can’t wait for the catch up I will either message Lache or use Slack to ask my fellow cohorts. 
                        </p>

                    <h3 class="question">What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h3>
                    <p class="question">I mainly expect guidance and support to let me know if I’m on the right path and when I happen to go off path then can redirect me. 
                        Also feedback on what I can improve on and what I am doing well. </p>

                    <h3 class="question">Any Schedule interruptions?</h3>
                    <p class="question">My weekday schedule is almost completely clear, and I have told my family that I will be living with whilst I study that when I’m studying I can’t be disturbed unless its urgent. Ive also planned that if I Know something is coming up that may take time out of my study hours I will do a few extra hours every day to make up or make up for it on the weekend.</p>
