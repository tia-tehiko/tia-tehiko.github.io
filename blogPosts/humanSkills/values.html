                    <li class="valueslist">Loyalty</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are a few of the main values that influence how I live my life and the decisions that I make.
                    Values essentially are beliefs and opinions that are important to an individual. </p>
                <hr>

                <h3>A Situation where I had to make a Ethical Decision</h3>
                <p>In recent years due to Social Media I have become more aware of certain companies and the ethics they
                    practice. More specifically fast fashion brands and their reputation for running unethical sweat
                    shops in third world countries, having extremely poor working conditions and trading/paying workers
                    unfairly all in the name of profit. When I was younger I was very ignorant to the practices of these
                    brands simply because it provided me with materialistic items I wanted at reasonably low prices.
                    Specifically the companies I used quite frequently were Nike, Adidas, Amazon and Boohoo. </p>
                <p>I then had to decide if the products I was receiving was worth my financial support to these
                    companies that ethically my values did not align with. Before making a decision I did my own
                    research into these companies to find information that was not just from social media in order to
                    get a fuller picture of the issue. After researching I found that not only were these companies
                    unethical in all the ways mentioned above but also learnt about how disastrous fast fashion is on
                    the environment. I also learnt about the purchasing power we have as individuals and that where we
                    choose to spend our money and the things we spend them on reflects our values. </p>
                <p>In the end I chose to no longer support these types of companies with my money and that I would no
                    longer purchase anything from or through these companies as my values simply do not align with
                    theirs and I could no longer ignore that. Instead I would invest my money on slightly more expensive
                    pieces that would have a longer lifetime and support smaller local businesses and companies that
                    have ethical practices</p>
                <p>The main consequence of this decision was that when I am looking to purchase something new my options
                    can be quite limited and usually more expensive.</p>

                <h3>How my culture has influence my Values & Identity</h3>
                <p>My culture has hugely affected my values and identity and the biggest way would be the importance I
                    place on Whānau.</p>
                <p>In the māori culture and in our home nothing is more important than our people. Whānau is placed
                    above everything including financial wealth and success.</p>
                <p>his was shown and influenced mainly through my parents and their behaviours and the way they placed
                    importance on these values and in turn taught that to us. My parents showed us that no matter what
                    they always do anything they could when it came to our people and also spending time with them was
                    always a priority. Now because of my upbringing I value my whānau and friends above all else. </p>
                <div class="whakatauki">
                    <p>One of my favourite whakataukī is</p>
                    <h4>“He aha te mea nui o te ao? He tāngata, he tāngata, he tāngata” </h4>
                    <p>which translates to</p>
                    <h4>“What is the most important thing in the world? It is people, it is people, it is people”</h4>
                </div>

                <h3>My Strengths and Limitations in terms of my Learning and Career Development</h3>
                <p>Some of my strengths that I think relate to my learning career and development are my ability to
                    adapt and pick up new skills and information, my easy going nature, my love for learning new things,
                    my hardworking nature and my practicality. </p>
                <p>In terms of limitations the flip side of being very adaptable and welcoming change means that at
                    times I can find it difficult to focus as the initial excitement of change wares off I sometimes can
                    easily lose interest which will result in my focus lacking.

                <h3>What Strengths of mine do I think will help with my learning journey?</h3>
                <p>Some of my strengths that I think will greatly benefit my learning journey are that I am a quick
                    thinker. I can think very quick on my feet and can usually move between different ideas with
                    relative ease.</p>
                <p>I am also quite knowledgeable on a broad variety of topics and will never pass up an opportunity to
                    learn something new. I believe that everyone you meet will know something you don’t so every
                    interaction with someone is a chance to learn something new. I love learning new things to add to my
                    database of knowledge as this is never ending and we are forever learning.</p>
                <p>I am also very adaptable and can pick up new skills very quickly. I don’t mind being outside of my
                    comfort zone so I welcome change which also relates back to learning new things.</p>
                <p>I am also quite charismatic and energetic and get along with people very easily.</p>

                <h3>My Experience with tension within the workplace and what strategies were used to overcome it</h3>
                <p>In my previous role I worked in a team of four. We all did the same role but looked after our
                    different resorts that we had assigned to us.</p>
                <p>The great thing about this dynamic was if any of us were away for some reason there was always others
                    on hand who knew how to do your job and could cover your work whilst you were away. It also meant
                    that we all did the same work, used the same processes and were aiming for the same outcomes. An
                    important part of our job was communication with the other members in our team and our manager
                    should any change happen or something occur that would affect our whole team.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately we had a member in our team who would constantly keep important things to themselves
                    which at times would be a huge detriment to our team.</p>
                <p>The first strategy used was to simply have a discussion with the team member regarding the issue in
                    the hopes that would be sufficient. However after all of our team members talking to her
                    individually did not seem to work we then went to our manager with the issue which resulted in us
                    having a team meeting and when that didn’t seem to affect any change our manager spoke with the team
                    member individually.</p>
                <p>Our first two strategies were not effective at all as the team member continued to keep things from
                    the team and it was not until it was escalated to the threat of a warning that she stopped.</p>
                <p>In hindsight I think it would have been helpful had we started with a team meeting to openly discuss
                    any issues and discord we had within the team as looking back I believe those were the underlying
                    issues behind the team member being resistant and approaching the team member by ourselves most
                    likely made the discover worst rather than better. </p>
