      <h3>Three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning</h3>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li class="lessonlist">
          How to Recognise my Inner Critic<br>
          The first thing I learnt was how to recognise my inner critic, the voice in my head that makes me doubt myself
          and tells me that I can't do something. The most important part about being able to recognise this inner
          critic is that I am able to stop it in its tracks before I let it derail me. When I recognise the voice
          telling me I cant do something I am able to remind myself of my Strengths and remind myself that anything is
          possible and anything is learnable through hardwork, effort and persistance. <br><br>
        </li>

        <li class="lessonlist">
          That EVERYTHING is Learnable<br>
          The second thing I learnt is that "Everything is Learnable". The most important thing about learning this is
          that whenever I want to give up on something and try to convince myself that I am unable to do something I
          know that this is just a cop out due to knowing that everything is learnable. <br><br>
        </li>

        <li class="lessonlist">
          That I am quite self aware<br>
          Going through all these core learnings has shown me how I am quite self aware and am able to be honest with
          myself and recognise my strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>
        The role of values, empathy and self and awareness in learning and programming is that it makes a huge
        difference in the speed of your learning, the efficiency and the quality. When you know what your strengths and
        weaknesses are you know where to focus more of your effort, it also helps you to know when tobe easier on
        yourself when struggling with certain things and when you just need to push through. Knowing your values helps
        you to find a learning style that is true to yourself.

      <h3>What surprised me the most about Core Learning? </h3>
      <p>
        The biggest surprise for me was how much of the core fundamental learnings I had already learnt and heard about
        before. It reinforced to me how important the core learnings were anyhow they are so beneficial not just for my
        coding journey but for my life in general.

      <h3>The most challenging aspects of the Core Learning for me. </h3>
      <p>
        The most challenging aspect of the core learning for me was implementing the practices and habits that I know
        are good for me and sticking with them. I have known for awhile the amazing benefits of meditating daily but
        have always struggled to turn this practice into a daily habit that becomes a non negotiable.

      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
        development bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>
        Because all the technical skills needed for a job can always be taught on the job however the core learning is
        not and it is usually the core lessons and skills that differentiate a great employee from an average one.
        <br>The core lessons taught are the ones that employers are looking for and also the skills that will aid your
        technical skills and allow you to be a better employee.
      </p>

      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? </h3>
      <p>
        Not at all, I LOVED the Core Learning!
